### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Ã–zgÃ¼r /Å“zgÊŠr/!

I am a software developer who has been coding for almost ten years. Usually, I am working on web applications on both sides; frontend and backend. I had many chances to work with different languages and technologies from zero to production.

I am the co-founder of some of the local communities on technology and music. I like sharing my experiences with people. That's why I like writing and talking about everything.

Also, I am interested in creating a startup which makes me proud of it. Although I fail usually, I am stubborn enough to keep going try.
