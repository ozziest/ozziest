### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Ã–zgÃ¼r /Å“zgÊŠr/!

Self-learner, inquisitive, and team player attributes can be useful words to describe me. I am the perfect start-up developer who knows the importance of time management, delivers software quickly, and cares about to assimilates business logic. I always like to be a developer who owned the product in all detail.

In the past, I have many experiences to develop B2B and B2C web applications. I am working with a passion to design desirable UI and usable UX for more than 10 years. I experienced many different programming languages and technologies until the time that understand the most important thing in software development is not programming languages or technologies. I believe that all technologies and languages used are just tools to make good products, that users love to use.

I would be happy to help you in many different areas such as software development, startup culture, delivering products, community management, leading teams, building scalable web applications, designing APIs, creating reusable libraries, etc.
